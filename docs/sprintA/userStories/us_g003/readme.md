# US G003

## 1. Context

This is a new task that hasnâ€™t been worked on before.

## 2. Requirements


**US G003** As Project Manager, I want the team to configure the project structure to facilitate/accelerate the development of upcoming user stories.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- G003.1. The project should support the envisioned architecture (which includes support for adopted technologies)

**Dependencies/References:**

Define the structure of the project to support the envisioned architecture, such as presented in Chapter 4, including support for adopted technologies
(e.g., ANTLR)


## 3. Integration/Demonstration

To help accelerate the development of the upcoming user stories, we have separated the project documentation from the 
code, to provide better clarity. 
Additionally, we also organised the code logically by dividing and creating folders based on their purpose.
