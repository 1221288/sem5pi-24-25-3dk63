*As Project Manager, I want the team to use the defined project repository (i.e., GitHub) and setup a tool for project management.*

## 1. Context

*This is the first time the task is assined to be developed*

## 2. Implementation

*For the creation of the GitHub repository, we followed the document 'GitHub Process to Create/Select a Team*
*As a tool for project management, we created a project (Sprint 1) on GitHub. We then created the sections: Sprint Backlog, In Progress, Blocked, Testing, and Completed. We assigned each user story and proceeded to start the sprint.*
