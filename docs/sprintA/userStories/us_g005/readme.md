# US G005

## 1. Context

It is the first time this task is being assigned to be developed.

## 2. Requirements

**US G005** As Project Manager, I want the team to add to the project the necessary scripts, so that build/executions/deployments/... can be executed effortlessly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- G005.1. The project scripts only refer to building the applications, running tests and executing the applications.

**Dependencies/References:**

Include scripts for all the major tasks and execution of applications.

## 3. Integration/Demonstration

The necessary scripts for this project were based on the scripts from the example eapli base project, available at https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/resource/view.php?id=193762.
Some folders/packages were renamed to fit this project's requirements.
